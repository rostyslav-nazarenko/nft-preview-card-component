Look further into transitions and animations.

- [Melvin Aguilar](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/MelvinAguilar) - gave suggestions on accessibility, such as correct use of `alt` attribute and **warned** about setting `html` to `font-size: 62.5%`, which is not a good trick to use. Provided resources listed above.
